# FormalCounterpoint

This project was conducted by Guilhem Marion during an internship at LIRMM (Computer Science lab of Montpellier) on his own. Later, it has been used as material for a TIPE for the Concours of the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon and a thesis (mémoire) in musicology at the University Lyon 2 Lumière. 

This project is about modelizing the grammar of counterpoint. I used the book 'traité de contrepoint' by Marcel Bitsch in which one can find one hundred rules about writing counterpoint. The idea is to formalize these rules in order to generate valid counterpoints. 
All the rules are hardcoded as logic propositions. This work has been used in two documents: my TIPE and my mémoire of first year of Master's Degree. In both, you can find information about how I made this program, analyses of the results, and theoretical things about musical grammar and Computer Science. If you want more information or if you are not comfortable with French, feel free to contact me. 

You can find the source code, some results (higher is the name of the directory better should be the results), the executables, and the documents I made around it.

Before to use or diffuse this code or its results, please contact me.
